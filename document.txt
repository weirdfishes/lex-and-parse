  > The major conflict was in resolving the expression production in the grammar.
  > This production initialliy could produce incorrect expressions, such as:
      > x = x + y > 2 + y;
  > This is because the expression production would recursively produce itself as 
  > well as other productions such as comparison expressions and assignment expressions.
  > To fix this, multiple different production rules and non-terminal symbols were added
  > in order to accomodate for the various situations
